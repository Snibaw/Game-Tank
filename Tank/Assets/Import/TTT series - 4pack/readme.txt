Thank you for your purchase!

Please note that the blank space on each tileset is there for future additions to the tilesets, or if you'd like to add to it yourself. This will hopefully ensure that reimporting the updated tilesets into your project won't cause any issues (existing tiles will remain in their current locations on each tileset).
